#+TITLE:Language Tests

I test various language functionalities and usage experience. The test would be a pain in the ass in C, which is what I'm trying to beat.

* The test
- Write a command-line tool which takes several optional arguments
- The tool creates and manipulates numeric data based on the arguments, then serializes the data to a file
- The file should include several different fields and a string or something (i.e. not a perfect 4-byte float dump)
- The tool can load from the file and manipulate that data

* The languages
** Zig
** Carp
** Steam Bank Common Lisp (SBCL)
* Criteria
** Features

| Language | Has REPL | Has hot-reloading | Introspection | Compile-time code generation |
|----------+----------+-------------------+---------------+------------------------------|
| Zig      |          |                   |               |                              |
| Carp     |          |                   |               |                              |
| SBCL     | Yes      |                   |               |                              |

** Implementation

| Language | My CLOC | Time to implement | Comments |
|----------+---------+-------------------+----------|
|          |         |                   |          |

** Maintainability/sustainability

| Language | CLOC | Repo health | Comments |
